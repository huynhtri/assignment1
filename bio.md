I enjoy playing piano, playing games, and programming on the little spare time I have.

Another thing that I enjoy doing is long walks on the beach because we have awesome beaches in Arizona.

I actually majored in piano for undergrad but I suffered from tendonitis from playing the piano for too
long so I was forced to change majors at that point. I still play piano poart time for choirs and occasionally
learn classical pieces to perform with friends.
