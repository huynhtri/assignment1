My name is Solomon and I got a BS in Accountancy at Northern Arizona University. I Currently live in
Phoenix, AZ working at the State of Arizona Department of Administration as an accountant. The job entails
accounting for all health insurance related matters for State employees, retirees, and people on COBRA as well
as tracking all construction in progress for the department. I decided to major in CS after working on Visual 
Basic macros on excel while working for the State.

I enjoy playing piano, playing games, and programming on the little spare time I have.

Another thing that I enjoy doing is long walks on the beach because we have awesome beaches in Arizona.
